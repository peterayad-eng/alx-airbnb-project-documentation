# User Stories

The user stories have been created from the use case diagram to capture the needs of different types of users (guests, hosts, administrators) in a more detailed and business value-oriented manner.

## These stories follow the standard format:

- As a [user type]
- I want to [action/feature]
- So that [benefit/value]

The stories are prioritized to guide the development order.
